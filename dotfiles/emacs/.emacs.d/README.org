A minimalist's Emacs configuration.
#+end_quote

* About
My Emacs configuration.  It is heavily tweaked for my personal taste so use it cautions.

This configuration intends to be as minimal as possible so Emacs built-in functionalities are preferred.

* Perks
- Lightweight and modular
- Respect vanilla Emacs keybindings (=evil-mode= only enabled in editing buffers)
- Terminal friendly
- Emacs 29+ only

* Get Started
Simply clone to the canonical Emacs configuration location.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/peromage/rice.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Or load it along with your personal configuration.

#+begin_src elisp
(load-file "~/rice/init.el")
#+end_src

Load the mini config.

#+begin_src bash
emacs -Q -l ~/rice/init-mini.el
#+end_src

Disposable changes are stored in =custom.el= at the root of this config directory.

* Key Bindings
=evil-mode= is enabled for editing buffers and outside of it the key bindings are kept in a vanilla fashion.  The reason is, I find that configuring every buffer to Vim style is exhausting and if I want to do that I would probably use Doom Emacs already.  And vanilla Emacs key bindings work consistently in shell.

In =evil-mode= the =SPC= is bound to =pewkey-map= where my major personal key bindings go.

This keymap can be activated via =pewkey= command as well.  When it is activated, =pewkey-map= becomes a transient map and exits after any command invoked in it.

=pewkey= supports repeat mode.  Use =C-r= to enable while the keymap is activated and use =C-g= to exit.  I don't use the new =repeat-mode= because it doesn't work well with my workflow.

Some of the meta bindings are replaced and reserved for my personal use.  They are bound with prefix command keymaps.  See [[./lisp/init-config.el][init-config.el]] for details.

* Fonts and Icons
For the display font I recommend [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka][Iosevka]] which is also the default font used by this configuration.

For the first time setup, =nerd-icons-install-fonts= and =all-the-icons-install-fonts= should be run in order to ensure modeline and other parts to display properly.
