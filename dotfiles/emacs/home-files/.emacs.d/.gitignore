## Emacs user directory is usually filled with random files. It would be a hassle
## to exclude them all.  Thus whitelist mode is used in this gitignore file.

## First, exclude all files
*

## Include pew config
!/pew/
!/pew/**

## But not compiled ELisp files
/pew/**/*.elc

## Include files at the root
!/.gitignore
!/LICENSE
!/README.org
!/early-init.el
!/init.el
!/init-mini.el

## Include cached package bundle
!/elpa-*.tar.gz

## Include straight.el lock file
!/straight/
!/straight/versions/
!/straight/versions/*

## Utility scripts
!/*.sh
